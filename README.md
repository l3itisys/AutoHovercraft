# AutoHovercraft

This repository contains the code for an Arduino-controlled hovercraft that uses Infrared (IR) and Ultrasonic (US) sensors for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## About The Project

The AutoHovercraft project is designed to give hands-on experience with the Arduino IDE and microcontroller features. It integrates Infrared and Ultrasonic rangefinders to measure distance and control an LED’s brightness. The project outputs distance and Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) readings to a screen via UART. Additionally, it demonstrates real-time sensor feedback, helping users understand how to interpret sensor data for obstacle detection.

### Key Features:

- **Sensor Integration**: Uses IR and US sensors to detect obstacles and control hovercraft behavior.
- **Distance Measurement**: Outputs the distance between sensors and obstacles, and adjusts LED brightness based on proximity.
- **Serial Communication**: Transmits real-time sensor data and ADC values through UART for monitoring.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Arduino IDE installed on your system
- Hardware:
  - Ultrasonic rangefinder (HC-SR04)
  - IR analog rangefinder (GP2Y0A21)
  - Arduino microcontroller
  - Voltmeter (Digital Multimeter - DMM)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoHovercraft.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE, and open the project from the cloned directory.
3. **Upload the code**:
   - Connect your Arduino board, verify the code, and upload it to the board.

### Wiring Instructions

- Connect the **Ultrasonic sensor** to the following pins:
  - Trigger pin to digital pin X
  - Echo pin to digital pin Y
- Connect the **IR analog sensor** to any available ADC channel on the Arduino.

Refer to the wiring diagram in the documentation folder for detailed connections.

## Usage

1. **Sensor Setup**: Connect the IR and Ultrasonic sensors to the board as described above.
2. **Run Trials**: Observe the hovercraft's behavior and fill out the performance table for your report based on the trial outcomes.
3. **Monitor Outputs**: View the distance readings and ADC output on the serial monitor.
4. **Observe LED Behavior**: Check how the LED’s brightness adjusts in real time based on the distance between the sensors and obstacles.
