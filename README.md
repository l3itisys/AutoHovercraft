# AutoHovercraft

Project Repository for an Arduino-controlled hovercraft that utilizes Infrared and Ultrasonic sensors for navigation.

## About The Project

This project is designed to give users a hands-on experience with Arduino IDE, microcontroller's features, Infrared (IR) and Ultrasonic (US) rangefinders, and datasheets. It also aims to control the brightness of D3 based on the distance between each sensor and an obstacle, and output the actual distance and ADC readings on the screen via UART.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Arduino IDE
* Ultrasonic rangefinder (HC-SR04)
* IR analog rangefinder (GP2Y0A21)
* A voltmeter (DMM)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE
3. Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board

## Usage

1. Connect the IR sensor to the board to any ADC channel of your choice.

2. Run the trials and fill out the table for the report as per the instructions given in the program.

3. Observe the sensor’s output and LED L’s behaviour.
